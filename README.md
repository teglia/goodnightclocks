goodnightclocks
===============

Not much to see here. This is a personal project proposed on a [Socrata job announcement page](http://www.socrata.com/career/front-end-software-engineer/). 

The gist of it is that you are supposed to write a program that will figure out the difference in degrees based on the total of the difference in minutes between two different times, as if you were looking at two analog clocks.

The complete description is:

"Allow the user to enter two times of the format “[H]H:MM AM”. Mentally picture these times on two analog clocks, each having an hour hand and a minute hand. Without using any built-in date or time routines, calculate the number of degrees the minute hand on the first clock must travel in order to have the second clock show the exact same time as the first clock. Assume that when you move the minute hand, the hour hand moves automatically. The minute hand may only move in the clockwise direction. You may assume that the minute hand always ends up on a perfect minute boundary."

Sounded like fun, and a good opportunity to get to know Angular.js, canvas, and Bootstrap.css a bit better. Practice is good fun!
