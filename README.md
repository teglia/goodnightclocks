goodnightclocks
===============

Not much to see here. This is a personal project proposed on a [Socrata job announcement page](http://www.socrata.com/career/front-end-software-engineer/). 

The gist of it is that you are supposed to write a program that will figure out the difference in degrees based on the total of the difference in minutes between two different times, as if you were looking at two analog clocks.

Sounded like fun, and a good opportunity to get to know Angular.js, canvas, and Bootstrap.css a bit better. Practice is good fun!
